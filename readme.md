# FizzBuzz using TDD

## program specifications

Write a program that walks through a range of numbers (1 - 100) & display the value of that iteration.

Here's the catch:

- If the number is divisible by 3, instead of mentioning the value of that iteration, display Fizz.
- If however, the number is divisible by 5, display Buzz.
- If the value is divisible by both 3 and 5, display FizzBuzz.

## expected behavior / requirements

1. for every number divisible by 3 instead mention "Fizz"
2. for every number divisible by 5 instead mention "Buzz"
3. for every number divisible by both 3 and 5 instead mention "FizzBuzz"
